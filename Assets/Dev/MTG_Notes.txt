Match - The entire game of MTG that is completed when one of the players wins
Round - Ends when each layer takes their turns
Turn - Ends for each player independently once they've completed all of their steps / phases
Turn Phase - There's generally 5 phases for each turn, they're split up to help the flow of the game
Phase Step - A phase step is a action that happens during a turn phase, a turn phase might have multiple steps so their actions are split up, a phase step should be reversable/undoable in the future
